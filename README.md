# polygon-docker: Docker automation for Polygon RPC nodes

## Overview

polygon-docker follows [eth-docker](https://eth-docker.net) conventions. A lot of the same basic patterns,
such as for traefik access, apply.

## Getting Started

For a quick start, you can install prerequisites and configure polygon-docker, as a non-root user:

* `cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/CryptoManufaktur-io/polygon-docker.git && cd polygon-docker`
* `./ethd install`
* `cp default.env .env` and adjust snapshot locations.
